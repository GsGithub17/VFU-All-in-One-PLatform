# VF-Unity
Streamlined version of VirtualFlow combining both VFVS and VFLP


## Prerequisites
Please clone the repository using: 
```
git clone git@github.com:VirtualFlow/VF-Unity.git
```
Please ensure that the following packages are installed: 
- [RDKit version 2021.09.5](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/Install.html)
- [Open Babel 3.1.0](https://openbabel.org/docs/dev/Installation/install.html)
- [Python 3.7.13](https://www.python.org/downloads/)



## Running a single example
For running a single example (a docking score of a single SMILES/SELFIES), we will be running `run_single.py`. Specifically, the following steps can be followed: 
1. Inside the `config` directory, please add a protein file, and a ligand file. We will be performing this demonstration using the protein `prot_1.pdb`, already pasted inside the `config` directory.
2. Please open the file `run_single.py`. At the top of the file are all the parameters for running the script. The parameters are, 
   - is_selfies     = False 
   - program_choice = 'smina' 
   - receptor       = './config/prot_1.pdb'
   - smi            = 'BrC=CC1OC(C2)(F)C2(Cl)C1.CC.[Cl][Cl]'
   - Parameters for executing the docking pose search: 
     - exhaustiveness = 10
     - center_x       = -16  
     - center_y       = 145  
     - center_z       = 27   
     - size_x         = 10  
     - size_y         = 10   
     - size_z         = 10   
3. Please do not worry. We will be describing these paramters one at a time! :)
4. We begin by looking at the paramter `smi`. The variable needs to be set to a valid smile string. To process the SMILE string, the program uses RdKit to (1) desaults, (2) neutralizes and (3) enumerates sterio-isomers. Subsequently, all molecules will be converted to 3D using OpenBabel. 
5. 


## Running in batch 


## Special Considerations
### Using AutoDock-GPU
Please compile the code using instructions from: [https://github.com/ccsb-scripps/AutoDock-GPU](https://github.com/ccsb-scripps/AutoDock-GPU). 
After successfull compilation, within the bin directory, an executable will be made (example name: `autodock_gpu_1wi`). Then, the code is ready to run. 
We provide an example inside `./executables/vf_gpu_example.zip`. Inside the directory, a prepared protein-ligand pair is provided and the code can be run 
using: `./autodock_gpu_1wi --ffile 1stp_protein.maps.fld --lfile ./1stp_ligand.pdbqt`


### Using EquiBind
Please download the code using instructions from: [https://github.com/HannesStark/EquiBind](https://github.com/HannesStark/EquiBind). 
Please create a conda enviroment per the instructions of the EquiBind repository. 
Copy paste all files inside the working directory of VF-Unity. 


### Using rDock
Please compile the code using the instruction provided in: [https://rdock.sourceforge.net/installation/](https://rdock.sourceforge.net/installation/). 
We installed rDock using anacond (with `conda install -c bioconda rdock`)
