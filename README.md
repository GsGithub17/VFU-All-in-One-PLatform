# Using AutoDock-GPU
Please compile the code using instructions from: [https://github.com/ccsb-scripps/AutoDock-GPU](https://github.com/ccsb-scripps/AutoDock-GPU). 
After successfull compilation, within the bin directory, an executable will be made (example name: `autodock_gpu_1wi`). Then, the code is ready to run. 
We provide an example inside `./executables/vf_gpu_example.zip`. Inside the directory, a prepared protein-ligand pair is provided and the code can be run 
using: `./autodock_gpu_1wi --ffile 1stp_protein.maps.fld --lfile ./1stp_ligand.pdbqt`
