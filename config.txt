# The choice of the docking method
# Possible choices:
# AutoDock-Koto, AutodockVina_1.2, AutodockZN, EquiBind, FRED
# FitDock, GalaxyDock3, LigandFit, LightDock, M-Dock
# MCDock, MM-GBSA, PLANTS, PSOVina, RLDock
# SEED, adfr, autodock_cpu, autodock_gpu, autodock_vina
# dock6, flexx, glide, gnina, gnina-scoring
# gold, gwovina, iGemDock, idock, ledock
# molegro, nnscore2, qvina, qvina-w, rDock
# rf-score, rosetta-ligand, smina, smina-scoring, vina
# vina_carb, vina_xb
# Please note: different pose prediction/docking methods can be combined with scoring functions.
# For example: ’qvina+nnscore2’.
# For supported choices/combinations please see the VirtualFlow homepage.

# The x,y&z coordinates of the center of the docking space. The binding space describes the location where a moolecule
# is allowed to bind.
center_x=10
center_y=10

# The size (in Angstroms) of the docking space in the x,y&z directions.
size_x=10
size_y=10
size_z=10

# How many poses to search for, providing a limit to the maximum number of iterations that a docking program performs in
# search for good poses
# Large exhaustiveness settings lead to increased computational costs.
